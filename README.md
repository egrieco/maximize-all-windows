# Maximize All Windows

A Firefox addon for maximizing all open browser windows.

Get the addon here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/maximize-all-windows/

## Motive

I like maximizing all of my browser windows, almost all the time. When restarting Firefox, or on the first start, my windows never consistently stay maximized. I decided to make this addon to programmatically maximize them on startup and whenever the extension icon is clicked.
